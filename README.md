Dear **Michael**,

A wholehearted day to you! Thank you very much for reaching out.

We are glad that you expressed your interest in volunteering and sharing your expertise as a Teaching Assistant in one of our classes. We believe the best education in the world should be freely accessible.

**CodePath** University students were held to the same high standards that we hold professional engineers to; they attended *mandatory 2-hour class* sessions *twice a week* and were required to complete and submit a weekly app assignment that often required 10+ hours of work outside of class. A semester is a 12-week long project based. CodePath courses are mainly Cybersecurity, Professional iOS, and Professional Android. 

To participate with a 12-week virtual course as a TA, please fill out the form [Interview Prep Courses - Mentor's Survey.][1] We also accept [volunteers in other ways.][2]
